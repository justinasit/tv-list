# TV-List Overview

- This application allows you to find any of your favourite TV series. It is useful for tracking releases of new seasons and marking off the ones you watched.
- Mark off all seasons as watched and the series will move to the "Finished" category.
- Finished shows will automatically move to "Active" once a new season of a show has been released.
- Archive a show once it's over by clicking the "Archive" button.
- Optionally add a note if you need.
- Uses TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch data.
